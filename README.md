## 🚀 About This Repository

This repository is part of my personal learning journey to master JavaScript through hands-on mini projects. Each project is designed to focus on a specific concept or problem-solving approach using vanilla JavaScript.

Whether it's working with browser events, manipulating the DOM, or fetching data from APIs, these projects help solidify both my fundamental and intermediate JS skills.
